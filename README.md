# GD Data Analytics competition - Virginia Tech

<img src="https://goo.gl/awGeXx"/>

As a part of Data Analytics course at Virginia Tech, a data analytics competition was organized by General Dynamics.<br/>
This repository consists of our source code and the project report which ultimately fetched our team members Silver Medal :) <br/>
GD is also a sponsor of the Discovery Analytics Center at Virginia Tech.

## Getting Started

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The original dataset for analysis consisted of 16GB of data.<br/>
However, the records in http_info.csv file has been reduced down from 28 to 1 million. All other files remain intact<br/>
The records were reduced so that the dataset could be compressed down to <strong>~500MB</strong>.<br/>
The reduced dataset for the project can be downloaded <a href="https://goo.gl/nm3PWg">here</a>.<br/>
